# GoExplorer

GoExplorer is a Go-based web application that provides country information and related news. The project started as a CLI tool and has been refactored to expose an HTTP API while keeping the CLI mode as fallback.

## Quick start

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example` if present) and set the required API keys and base URLs:

```env
REST_COUNTRIES_API_BASE_URL=https://restcountries.com/v3.1
GNEWS_API_BASE_URL=https://gnews.io/api/v4
GNEWS_API_KEY=your_gnews_api_key_here
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Run the application

- Start the HTTP server (default port 8080):

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli --serve --port 8080
```

The server exposes a simple endpoint to get country info and related news:

```
GET /api/country/{name}
```

- Use the CLI mode for quick lookups (positional country name):

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli Brazil
```

- Makefile helpers (from project root):

```bash
make run COUNTRY=Brazil      # run CLI mode
make serve PORT=8080           # (if you want) start the server via Makefile
make build                     # build the binary into ./bin
```
